## Serving: model/API dependency version mismatch (unresolved)

**Problem:**
Models are logged via `mlflow.pytorch.log_model(..., code_paths=["src"])`
(<ref_snippet file="/d:/personal_project/image_classifier/src/callbacks.py" lines="114-122" />),
which bundles the model class source code with the artifact, but does **not**
pin the runtime dependency versions used during training (e.g. `timm`,
`torch`). The serving API (`api/predictor.py`) loads models in-process via
`mlflow.pytorch.load_model()` inside a single container built from
`requirements/api_req.txt`
(<ref_file file="/d:/personal_project/image_classifier/docker/services/api/Dockerfile" />).

If different developers train models with different dependency versions
(e.g. `timm==1.0.26` vs `timm==1.0.28`), one fixed API container cannot
correctly serve all of them. We hit this already and worked around it by
pinning `timm==1.0.26` in `api_req.txt`, but that's not a real fix — it just
makes the container match whichever model was trained most recently.

**Options discussed (see chat history for full breakdown, brainstormed on 2026-08-11):**
1. Log `pip_requirements` / `extra_pip_requirements` with the model at log-model
   time, and switch serving to `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model()` (supports env
   isolation) — requires refactoring how `predictor.py` calls the model.
2. Build a dedicated Docker image per model/run, using the model's logged
   `conda.yaml` to generate exact requirements — no `predictor.py` changes,
   but adds a build/deploy pipeline step.
3. Dynamically `pip install` the model's exact requirements at API container
   startup (before loading the model) — single container, adapts per model,
   but slow startup and can't serve two conflicting-version models at once.
4. Pin exact versions across `training_req.txt` and `api_req.txt` and enforce
   everyone uses the same environment — zero code changes, simplest, but
   doesn't scale with multiple developers/experiments.

**Recommendation (not yet implemented):** Do (1) regardless — always log
`pip_requirements` with the model, it's cheap and gives us metadata/options
later. Combine with (3) short-term for flexibility, revisit (2) if startup
latency becomes a problem or models need to run concurrently with
conflicting dependency versions.

**Status:** Not started. Revisit before onboarding more developers to
training or before relying on this for production serving.

## Drift detection: parallelisation approach (decided, shelved)

**Context:**
`TilePredictor.predict()` already batches tiles per image (~100 tiles
per image → one `model(batch_of_100)` call). The GPU is already
well-utilized per image, so cross-image batching gives negligible gain.

**Decision: shelve `batch_predict`**
A `batch_predict()` method was designed (see
`docs/plans/batch-predict.md`) but is shelved because `predict()`
already batches tiles at the GPU level. Adding cross-image batching
would add complexity for no meaningful speedup.

**Why threads don't work here:**
- Psycopg 3 connections are not thread-safe. A shared `DBLogger`
  cannot be used across threads — parallel `predict()` calls sharing
  `self.db_logger` would corrupt connection state and return wrong IDs.
- Multiple threads calling `self.model(...)` on one GPU serialize at
  the hardware level (CUDA queues kernels sequentially) — no speedup.
- Python GIL limits CPU-side parallelism for preprocessing/tiling/DB
  logging to ~1.3-1.5x, not true N×.

**Future approach: multi-process with `--shard` and `--device`**
True parallelism comes from **one process per hardware resource**,
each with its own `DBLogger` connection and `TilePredictor` instance,
processing disjoint shards of the samples. No locks, no shared state.

```
# Multi-GPU (true N× speedup):
python compute_reference.py --shard 0/2 --device cuda:0
python compute_reference.py --shard 1/2 --device cuda:1

# CPU-only multi-process (true N× on CPU):
python compute_reference.py --shard 0/4 --device cpu
python compute_reference.py --shard 1/4 --device cpu
python compute_reference.py --shard 2/4 --device cpu
python compute_reference.py --shard 3/4 --device cpu

# Mixed GPU + CPU (GPU gets most samples, CPU offloads a few):
python compute_reference.py --shard 0/3 --device cuda:0   # GPU, ~70% of samples
python compute_reference.py --shard 1/3 --device cpu      # CPU, ~15% of samples
python compute_reference.py --shard 2/3 --device cpu      # CPU, ~15% of samples
```

**Why multiple processes/pods are safe but threads are not:**
- Each process/pod has its **own Psycopg connection**. PostgreSQL uses
  MVCC and handles hundreds of concurrent connections natively.
- A single Psycopg connection shared across threads corrupts because
  the connection has internal protocol state (current query, transaction,
  result buffer) that can't be interleaved.
- The rule: **one worker = one process = one connection.**

**Mixed CPU+GPU caveat:**
CPU inference is 10-50x slower than GPU for typical CNN models. The
CPU processes become the bottleneck unless:
- The model is small (CPU only 5-10x slower).
- There are many CPU cores (8+) and thousands of samples.
- The GPU process gets the majority of samples.
For hundreds of reference samples, single-GPU `predict()` in a loop
is sufficient. Mixed CPU+GPU is only worth it for very large jobs.

**What NOT to do:**
- Do not `ThreadPoolExecutor` parallel `predict()` with a shared
  `DBLogger` — Psycopg 3 will break.
- Do not run multiple processes on the **same GPU** — CUDA serializes
  kernels across processes, so you get the same throughput with extra
  memory overhead (two model copies on GPU) and context-switch cost.
  The only exception is NVIDIA MPS, which is complex and not worth it
  here.
- Do not `multiprocessing` with a shared `DBLogger` — connections are
  not picklable across processes.

**Status:** Decision made. `batch_predict` shelved. Multi-process
`--shard`/`--device` approach documented for future implementation
when `compute_reference.py` needs to scale beyond a single GPU.
Kubernetes horizontal scaling (step 7) uses the same pattern at
larger scale with a job queue.
